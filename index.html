      <p>Classes are officially over. It's strangely bittersweet to think that I'll never experience the nerve-wracking energy of the 4th floor video rooms in Henry Angus again<span class="typing-dots"></span></p>

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>This course taught me that communication is less about speaking, and more about connecting. I came in thinking presentations were about slides and sounding smart. But I learned it’s really about intention, structure, and empathy. One moment that stuck with me was when we were encouraged to think about audience takeaways. That shift—from performance to impact—changed how I approached every presentation after that.</p>

      <h2>Presentation Journey</h2>
      <p>My first presentation was clunky—I talked too fast, my slides were crowded, and I could barely make eye contact. But the feedback was clear and kind, and I tried to apply it right away. By the third presentation, I was experimenting with storytelling structures and visuals. One that I remember well was my presentation on [insert topic here]—I used a simple anecdote and noticed the class actually engaged more. That felt like a turning point.</p>

      <h2>My Strengths</h2>
      <p>Clarity is my biggest strength. I naturally want to break down complicated ideas so they make sense—and this course showed me how to do that visually and verbally. One group project reminded me of this: our team had a complex concept, and I helped shape our message into three main points with a consistent theme. It made a huge difference. I also found that I enjoy designing slide decks that feel cohesive and purposeful—something I never thought I’d care about before this class.</p>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>I’m studying computer science, and honestly, I didn’t expect to find a class like this so valuable. But now I see how vital communication is—whether I’m pitching an idea, explaining code, or collaborating with a team. These skills don’t just belong in boardrooms—they belong in project meetings, in technical interviews, in life. I’ll take everything I learned with me as I grow as a developer, teammate, and storyteller.</p>
