      <p>Looking back on my previous diary entries, I realize that I would hyperfixate when preparing for presentations. Ahead of my informative presentation, I focused on not speaking too quickly. After all, we spent a whole class on voice and pace, and by the end of it I could vividly picture Elizabeth showing us breathing exercises and pleading us to relax and slow down. I was definitely relaxed when delivering that presentation–so much so that I nearly put <i>myself</i> to sleep. I spoke too slowly and added too many pauses, which effectively annihilated my momentum. As they say, everything in moderation.</p>
      <div class="sticky-note">
        <p class="original">Note to self: Don’t speak too fast!</p>

      <p>In worrying too much about my speaking pace, I lost sight of what–and more importantly, <i>who</i>–truly mattered. I was speaking about the US TikTok ban, which people had told me was an interesting and relevant topic. Yet when I looked out into the audience, praying that someone would make eye contact with me, I was met with the tops of heads.</p>

      <!-- Presentation journey -->
      <p>My first presentation was clunky—I talked too fast, my slides were crowded, and I could barely make eye contact. But the feedback was clear and kind, and I tried to apply it right away. By the third presentation, I was experimenting with storytelling structures and visuals. One that I remember well was my presentation on [insert topic here]—I used a simple anecdote and noticed the class actually engaged more. That felt like a turning point.</p>

      <!-- Strengths -->
      <p>Clarity is my biggest strength. I naturally want to break down complicated ideas so they make sense—and this course showed me how to do that visually and verbally. One group project reminded me of this: our team had a complex concept, and I helped shape our message into three main points with a consistent theme. It made a huge difference. I also found that I enjoy designing slide decks that feel cohesive and purposeful—something I never thought I’d care about before this class.</p>

      <!-- Looking ahead -->
      <p>I’m studying computer science, and honestly, I didn’t expect to find a class like this so valuable. But now I see how vital communication is—whether I’m pitching an idea, explaining code, or collaborating with a team. These skills don’t just belong in boardrooms—they belong in project meetings, in technical interviews, in life. I’ll take everything I learned with me as I grow as a developer, teammate, and storyteller.</p>
