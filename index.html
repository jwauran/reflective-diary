      <p>Classes are officially over. Strangely enough, I’ll miss the buzz surrounding the 4th floor video rooms – the anxious foot tapping, quiet muttering, nervous pacing. Some are frantically reading through their scripts, others are ready to go off the cuff. I was always somewhere in the middle, teetering between being rehearsed and sounding natural. I tried to strike the right balance, but in my focus I may have overlooked the bigger picture<span class="typing-dots"></span></p>

      <p>I'm reminded of this past summer, when I brought my new Fujifilm camera to Indonesia. I had been saving up for it and was excited to take it on a trip. At one of the most iconic (and crowded) viewpoints, I spent several minutes setting myself up to get the perfect shot. It was nearly 40 degrees out, and there was a constant stream of tourists that never seemed to end. I felt rushed, but in the viewfinder, everything looked great.</p>

          <p>The photo I took at Kelingking Beach, Bali.</p>

      </div>
      <p>When we got back in the car to set off for the next spot, I was shocked to discover that my photos at that spot were completely overexposed. Other photos that I spent close to no effort taking turned out better. The details I worked so hard to capture were gone, washed out by the Indonesian sun.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I had the camera. I had the setup. I even had the vision. But I was so confident I had nailed it that I didn’t bother to check the photos before leaving.</p>

      <p>Ahead of my first presentation, I had one pinpointed focus: don’t speak too fast. After all, we spent a whole class on voice and pace, and by the end of it I could vividly picture Elizabeth showing us breathing exercises and pleading with us to relax and slow down. I was definitely relaxed when delivering that presentation–so much so that I nearly put <i>myself</i> to sleep. I spoke too slowly and added too many pauses, which effectively annihilated my momentum. As they say, everything in moderation.</p>
      <div class="sticky-note">
        <p class="original">Note to self: Don’t speak too fast!</p>
        <p class="updated">But also… don’t make your audience suffer.</p>

      <p>In worrying too much about my speaking pace, I lost sight of what–and more importantly, <i>who</i>–truly mattered. I was speaking about the US TikTok ban, which I had been told was an interesting and relevant topic. Yet when I looked out into the audience, praying that someone would make eye contact with me, I was met with the tops of heads.</p>

      <p>In reflecting on these moments, I realized that every presentation was an opportunity for me to experiment and find that balance between a well-crafted presentation and an authentic delivery. Without effective content, people won’t know or understand. Without effective delivery, people won’t connect or care.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I’ve always been a confident speaker. I got over my stage fright in elementary school, thanks to all the skits I performed at church as a kid. I can project my voice, vary my pace, and adjust my tone. These are strengths I leaned on, sometimes too heavily.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I needed to take a step back and focus more on my audience instead of just checking boxes off a list. Are these details too personal, making it difficult for people to relate? Does my message appeal too broadly, not providing any unique value or insight? Would my point be better conveyed with a story or a statistic? The details were important, no question about that. But the bigger picture, the experience I facilitated in those few minutes when people had no choice but to listen, was what really mattered. I was doing things <i>right</i>, but I wasn’t doing the <i>right</i> things.</p>

      <p>I used to think the biggest challenge of a presentation was figuring out what to say and remembering to say it. <i>I can write up a polished script with everything I need to say,</i> I thought. Throughout the course of the term, I realized I could not have been more wrong.</p>
      <div class="quote-box">

      <p>It can be easier for me to focus on technique, and to hide behind a logical structure and my natural confidence. But what takes more courage, and more care, is showing up fully, paying attention, and inviting others in. I need to get real muddy.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This course didn’t just make me a better presenter. It reminded me to be generous with my audience, recognizing that they’ve given me their time, attention, and energy. The goal isn’t to check every box; it’s to leave something behind that matters. That takes clarity, care, and courage. To offer something honest and vulnerable. Something meaningful.</p>
      <br>
      <p>And not just in my presentations—in everything I do.</p>
